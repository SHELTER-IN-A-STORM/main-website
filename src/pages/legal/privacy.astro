                <h2>Cookies & Other Tracking Technologies</h2>
                <p>
                    We and our third party service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Website or Services. We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you (and our third party service providers may do so on our behalf).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Currently, our systems do not recognize browser "do-not-track" requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies).
                </p>

                <p>
                    When you come to the Website, our web server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent-based cookies. We also may permit certain third party cookies to be placed on our Website.
                </p>

                <h3>Session Cookies</h3>
                <p>
                    Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you while you are logged into the Website. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests, and to verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Website.
                </p>

                <h3>Persistent Cookies</h3>
                <p>
                    Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. We may use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity, which may be combined with other user information.
                </p>

                <h3>Third Party Analytics</h3>
                <p>
                    We may use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Website. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Services. We use these tools to help us improve our Services, performance and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services. We do not share your personal information with these third parties.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You may be able to opt-out or restrict the collection or use of information by some commonly used tracking pixels and services. The following links are provided for your convenience:

                </ul>

                <h3>Disabling Cookies</h3>
                <p>
                    Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Website visitors who disable their web browsers' ability to accept cookies will be able to browse the Website; however, you must enable cookies to use most of our Services.

                <h2>Security of Your Information</h2>
                <p>
                    We want the information that you submit to us to be secure. We use industry-standard techniques to safeguard the information that you provide to us through our Website. Notwithstanding our commitment to your information, please be aware that there is a risk that others could find a way to thwart our security systems or the security systems of the third parties that host our server. As a result, we cannot ensure or warrant the security or privacy of any information that you choose to submit to us.

                <p>
                    You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.
                </p>

                <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>
                    Our Website is not intended for persons under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect information from persons under the age of 13. If we learn that a person under the age of 13 has created an account or directly applied for programs through our Website, then we will remove that information from our systems. Please be advised, however, that certain programs offered by third parties may be applicable to persons under the age of 13 or may require us to provide information about the children in your household. In those situations, we only collect information about persons under the age of 13 directly from the registered user, which must be a person over the age of 13.
                </p>
